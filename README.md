##Why make icon fonts?
Icon fonts are a great way to add customization to a website and are easy to use. Icon fonts are vector images that can be resized without the worry of the image becoming pixelated or distorted. They are usually a single color, but this color can be changed through css, eliminating the extra steps of having to change the image in Illustator or Photoshop. They can also be mapped to the keyboard which makes them very easy to use.



##How do you make them?
 Using a free resource, such as Fontastic, makes the process of making icon fonts fairly simple. You begin by making an account, and then you are directed to upload your content. First, You make a vector image in a program, such as Illustrator. When making the image, it is necessary to expand any stokes used, and to use only a single color, as any other color used will be converted to black. I also found that it is beneficial to merge different shapes because shapes on different layers can interact in unexpected ways when they are uploaded to the website and cause unexpected problems. Another thing to keep in mind is scalability, if the icons are too detailed, it will be lost as the images are scaled down.  After finishing the icon, save the file as an svg file.  Back on Fontastic, you simple select the upload button and your svg file and it wil be added to a new icon font collection. After uploading all content, you are then able to customize each icon by mapping them to the keyboard, and choosing a css tag for each. Then your icon font is ready to be downloaded and be used!
